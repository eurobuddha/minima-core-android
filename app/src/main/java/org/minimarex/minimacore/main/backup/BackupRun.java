/**
 * One in-progress `backup`, independent of Activity recreation.
 *
 * Same reasoning as ResyncSession, smaller problem: a backup locks the DB and copies the whole
 * wallet, chain and archive, which is slow on a phone. If the result lived in the Activity a
 * rotation would lose it, and the user would be told nothing while a .bak they cannot see
 * quietly appears in the node folder. Unlike a resync this is NOT destructive and does not
 * restart the node, so it deliberately does NOT go through ResyncLauncher.
