/**
 * The `vault` commands, built and validated in one place.
 *
 * Same contract as {@link ResyncJob}: a builder returns null when the input is not safe to put
 * into a node command, so an invalid value can never reach CommandRunner. The node has no escape
 * character - see ResyncJob for why that makes validation the only defence. vault.java has its
 * own partial guard (it refuses ';' in a password), which is a hint in the same direction rather
 * than a reason to relax anything here.
 *
 * These commands are NOT destructive to the chain and do not restart the node, so unlike restore
 * they do not go through ResyncLauncher. wipekeys IS destructive to the wallet, which is why the
 * node makes the caller hand back the seed to prove they hold it.
