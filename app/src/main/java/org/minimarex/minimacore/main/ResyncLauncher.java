/**
 * The one way a destructive node job is started, from any screen or from the health check.
 *
 * These steps are not optional and not obvious, which is exactly why they must not exist
 * twice: the pending flag has to be committed BEFORE the destructive command so a process
 * death cannot look like success; the alarms have to be cancelled so restart stays under
 * the user's control; and MainActivity's service binding has to be released or the node's
 * stopSelf at job completion never reaches onDestroy.
 *
 * Restore and MegaMMR-from-file restart the node exactly as a host resync does, so they come
 * through here too. Anything that runs a restarting command straight from an Activity is a bug.
