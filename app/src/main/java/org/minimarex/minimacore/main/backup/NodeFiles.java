/**
 * The node's base folder, and moving bytes between it and Android storage.
 *
 * THE POINT OF THIS CLASS: MinimaReceiver's FILE bridge enforced two rules on every companion
 * app - a path must resolve inside the base folder, and a write must never land in the live
 * "databases" folder. Running in-process bypasses that bridge completely, which means bypassing
 * its guardrails too. They are re-implemented here, deliberately matching MinimaReceiver's
 * resolveInBase/checkWriteAllowed, so the node's own UI is held to the rules it holds every
 * other app to rather than being trusted because it is "inside".
 *
 * The base folder is getFilesDir(): MinimaService starts the node with
 * "-data <getFilesDir()>", so GeneralParams.DATA_FOLDER and getFilesDir() are the same place,
 * and that is where backup / archive export / txnexport write.
